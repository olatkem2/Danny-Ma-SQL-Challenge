## This Project will document the solutions to Danny Ma's SQL Challenge Case Studies. 

It is meant to be for 8 weeks but I will take it easy on myself and just set a goal of solving a minimum of a question per day.

Here's a link to the Challenge https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/

## Tools

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Microsoft SQL  Server
3. Github
4. Any other online resource

## Steps

1. Download and install VS Code, MS SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio
2. Download necessary extensions in VS Code (Git, Remote Repository, MS SQL Server)
3. Create a connection in VS Code with MS SQL Server (Servername, Databasename, Windows-Authention/Username-Password Authention and Connection name)
4. Create a connection in VS Code with Git(i.e creating git configs in VS Code (username and password) which can be global or repo-specific)
5. Sign in to VS Code
